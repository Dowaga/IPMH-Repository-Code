## 1.1 Study Timeline Since Initiation:
-   May 12, 2023: Initial IRB approval
-   Jun 05, 2023: Initial ERC approval
-   Sep 19, 2023: RO1 Start date
-   Oct 04, 2024: Research assistant (RA) training initiation
-   Oct 11, 2024: 1st DSMB meeting
-   Oct 23, 2024: Facility randomization
-   Nov 06, 2024: Facility staff training initiation
-   Feb 17, 2025: Perinatal women recruitment initiation
-   [Place holder, we are not about 22%]: 25% of planned enrollment

## 1.2 Key Changes to Study Protocol
We requested for a modification from the Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Research Committee on 29th April 2025 to include women from >=20 weeks gestation because most of the participants enrolled from >=28 weeks gestation were not completing the required 5 sessions of the Problem Management+ (PM+) psychotherapy that is offered as part of the intervention due to delivery. By modifying the inclusion criteria, our participants have adequate time to receive the required 5 sessions of PM+ and we will be able to evaluate the mechanism of action of PM+ which is a secondary outcome for the study.

source("Consort.R")
n_anc <- consort_data %>% filter(anc_attendees=="Yes") %>% nrow()
n_ass<- consort_data %>% filter(!is.na(arm)) %>% nrow()
n_eligible <- consort_data %>% filter(rct_eligible == 1) %>% nrow()
n_eligible_per <- round(n_eligible/n_ass *100, 1)
n_enrol <- consort_data %>% filter(rct_enrolling == "Yes") %>% nrow()
n_enrol_per <- round(n_enrol/n_eligible *100, 1)
n_second <- consort_data %>% filter(!is.na(secondvisit)) %>% nrow()
n_second_per <- round(n_second/n_enrol * 100, 1)
# 14 Weeks Visit
n_third <- consort_data %>% filter(!is.na(thirdvisit)) %>% nrow()
n_third_per <- round(n_third/n_enrol * 100, 1)

# 6 Months Visit
n_fourth <- consort_data %>%
    filter(rct_enrolling == "Yes", fourthvisit == "Yes") %>%nrow()

n_fourth_per <- round(n_fourth/n_enrol * 100, 1)

```

We began recruiting pregnant women into the study on February 17, 2025. `r n_enrol` participants have been recruited into the study, meeting `r round(n_enrol/2970, 1)`% of our enrollment target.

Of the enrolled participants, `r n_second` (`r n_second_per`%) have completed their 6 weeks, `r n_third` (`r n_third_per`%) have completed 14 weeks and `r n_fourth` (`r n_fourth_per`%) have completed 6 months postpartum follow-up visits.

In general, the enrollment had a good start and has progressed well despite challenges right before and into the enrollment like the stop work order, which led to HIV Implementing partners staff being away for one week (Feb 3, 2025 - Feb 7, 2025), just two weeks before the launch of study enrollment. Enrollment was halted for about three weeks (March 4, 2025 - March 26, 2025) at one site (Ober Kamoth sub-county hospital) because the lay providers who support screening clients for PMAD symptoms, a gateway into the study for potential study participants with PMAD symptoms, were away on leave. For two weeks (March 17, 2025 - March 28, 2025) at Gita Subcounty, the lay providers were not reporting to duty daily;  however, this did not greatly impact enrollment at the site. Over this duration, we have been doing the enrollments despite the challenges with HIV Implementing Partner staff demotivation as a result of uncertainty with the continuation of their contracts. 

We halted enrollment of new participants on 1st  August 2025 after the grant period ended on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2025, pending approval of the Notice of Award from the National Institute of Health.  We received the Notice of Award on 8th September 2025, and enrollments resumed on 22<sup>nd<sup> September 2025. During this period, follow up visits at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 6 months postpartum continued. 

In Siaya County, there is an ongoing nurses strike which begun on 18<sup>th<sup> September 2025. The strike has affected participant enrollment in 5 intervention and 4 control sites, where we have not enrolled new participants into the study since the start of the strike. However, in one control site in Siaya, the facility has hired a locum nurse for the maternal child health clinic, and enrollment has been ongoing for the past 2 weeks. In all intervention sites, PM+ offered by lay providers and telepsychiatry offered by psychiatrists has been ongoing.

## 3.1 Overall Cohort

### 3.1.1 Current subject status

So far, we screened `r n_ass` women for eligibility among `r n_anc` non-unique ANC attendees at recruitment sites. Of these, `r n_eligible` (`r n_eligible_per`%) were eligible across intervention and control clusters. `r n_enrol` (`r n_enrol_per`%) participants consented to participate in the study and were enrolled into the study.

### 3.2.2 Enrollment Progress - Overall

Recruitment of women living with HIV (WLWH) into the cohort has been slower than initially anticipated, but continues to show steady improvement. Out of the total enrollment target of 20 WLWH per facility, three facilities have reached the halfway mark with 10 participants each, while six additional facilities have achieved at least 25% of their target, enrolling five WLWH per site.

# 7. Referrals

## 7.1 Psychosocial Referrals

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source("PPW RCT Referrals.R")

total_visits <- referral_df %>%nrow()
total_scr_num <- df_long %>% nrow()
total_scr_per <- round(total_scr_num/total_visits *100, 1)
total_ref_num <- df_long %>% filter(referral_accept == "Yes") %>% nrow()
total_ref_per <- round(total_ref_num/total_scr_num *100, 1)

```


During enrollment and follow up study visits,  participants are asked if they would like to be referred for psychosocial support if they screen positive for depression, anxiety and intimate partner violence (IPV). Out of `r total_visits` total study visits, `r total_scr_num` (`r total_scr_per`%) participants have screened positive for  referable conditions, of which, `r total_ref_num` (`r total_ref_per`%) accepted the referrals.

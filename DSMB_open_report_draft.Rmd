## 2.1 Recruitment Timeline
```{r source_consort, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("Consort.R")
n_anc <- consort_data %>% filter(anc_attendees=="Yes") %>% nrow()
n_ass<- consort_data %>% filter(!is.na(arm)) %>% nrow()
n_eligible <- consort_data %>% filter(rct_eligible == 1) %>% nrow()
n_eligible_per <- round(n_eligible/n_ass *100, 1)
n_enrol <- consort_data %>% filter(rct_enrolling == "Yes") %>% nrow()
n_enrol_per <- round(n_enrol/n_eligible *100, 1)
n_second <- consort_data %>% filter(!is.na(secondvisit)) %>% nrow()
n_second_per <- round(n_second/n_enrol * 100, 1)
```

We began recruiting pregnant women into the study on February 17, 2025. `r n_enrol` participants have been recruited into the study, meeting `r round(n_enrol/2970, 1)`% of our enrollment target. Of these, `r n_second` (`r n_second_per`%) have completed their 6-week postpartum follow-up with our study team.

In general, the enrollment had a good start and has progressed well despite challenges right before and into the enrollment like the stop work order, which led to HIV Implementing partners staff being away for one week (Feb 3, 2025 - Feb 7, 2025), just two weeks before the launch of study enrollment. Enrollment was halted for about three weeks (March 4, 2025 - March 26, 2025) at one site (Ober Kamoth sub-county hospital) because the lay providers who support screening clients for PMAD symptoms, a gateway into the study for potential study participants with PMAD symptoms, were away on leave. For two weeks (March 17, 2025 - March 28, 2025) at Gita Subcounty, the lay providers were not reporting to duty daily;  however, this did not greatly impact enrollment at the site. Over this duration, we have been doing the enrollments despite the challenges with HIV Implementing Partner staff demotivation as a result of uncertainty with the continuation of their contracts.

# 3. Study Enrollment 

## 3.1 Overall Cohort

### 3.1.1 Current subject status

So far, we screened `r n_ass` women for eligibility among `r n_anc` non-unique ANC attendees at recruitment sites. Of these, `r n_eligible` (`r n_eligible_per`%) were eligible across intervention and control clusters. `r n_enrol` (`r n_enrol_per`%) participants consented to participate in the study and were enrolled into the study. `r n_second` (`r n_second_per`%) completed their 6-weeks postpartum visit.

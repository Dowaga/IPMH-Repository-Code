# 4. CHP Workflow Process Outcomes
CHPs perform their duties based on "tasks" in eCHIS. ANC tasks are periodically assigned to CHPs for completion based on the gestational age of a mother. PNC tasks are periodically assigned to CHPs based on the age of a newborn. SMS scheduling and some mortality cohort outcomes are based on data collected by CHPs in ANC and PNC tasks. Therefore, completion of ANC and PNC tasks may align with the fidelity of intervention implementation and overall data collection for study outcomes. The table below summarizes task completion data for all tasks past their date scheduled for completion.



```{r chp_workflows, echo=FALSE}

# 5. Time from Delivery to eCHIS Delivery Report
Timely ascertainment of delivery enables timely scheduling of postpartum visits by CHPs and, in the intervention arm, initiation of time-sensitive postpartum messaging. The tables below summarize the time from delivery date to delivery report submission in eCHIS.

# 6. Two Way SMS
We have been monitoring CHPsâ€™ responsiveness to client SMS as an indicator of intervention fidelity. To optimize intervention delivery, we are using audit and feedback to share this data with CHPs and their supervisors on a monthly basis and identify ways to improve intervention delivery.

# 7. Adverse Events


## 7.1 Mortality cohort 
The final mortality cohort will consist of only those who experienced live births at the end of their pregnancies. In order to report pregnancy losses, the adverse event data shown below is for all pregnancies in eCHIS.

## 7.2 Sub cohort 
A total of `r overall_ae_num` adverse events have occurred among 2000 study participants.The most common adverse event was infant death, which occurred among `r overall_infdeath_per` of total study participants.The table below lists characteristics of adverse events. None have been determined to have been related to study procedures.
